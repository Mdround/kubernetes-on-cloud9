# kubernetes-on-cloud9
Non-automated scripts for setting up Kubernetes and Kubeflow within AWS on Cloud9

The two most useful scripts are both based on Amazon's own EKS workshop:
* kubernetes-setup.md
* kubeflow-install-eks-workshop.md

They were written in Sep 2019. Haven't been checked recently, but they should still work.
